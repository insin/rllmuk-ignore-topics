# Rllmuk Ignore Topics

![Rllmuk Logo](icons/icon128.png)

* [Install Chrome Extension]()
* [Install Firefox Add-on]()
* [Install as a user script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/38321-rllmuk-topic-ignore-list-invision-4) (requires a [user script manager](https://greasyfork.org/en#home-step-1))

## Ignoring

Hover over a topic and a trash icon will appear; clicking it will hide the topic, and it will be hidden on subsequent visits to the forum it's in and on the Unread Content page.

On the Unread Content page, a trash icon will also appear next to the forum a topic is in - clicking it will hide all topics in that forum when browsing Unread Content.

## Unignoring

If you've accidentally ignored the wrong thing, or if you decide you actually _do_ like _insert name of collectible physical object_ or _insert name of football club_ that much, open your browser's right-click/context menu and click "Show ignored topics" (this will be a top-level item in Firefox and under a "Rllmuk Ignore Topics" menu item in Chrome).

Ignored topics will be displayed with a fetching salmon highlight and clicking the appropriate trash icon (you may have have ignored them individually, by forum or both) will unignore them. You can then re-hide them using the same menu item.

## Bonus Feature

By default, this extension also restores the "make topic links go to latest post" functionality which had to be removed during a previous forum upgrade.
